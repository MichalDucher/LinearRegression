# Linear Regression with Visualization

This project implements linear regression with animated visualization using Python. The program utilizes the matplotlib library for visualization and scikit-learn for linear regression computation.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:


## Usage

To run the program, execute the script `main.py`. The program will generate animated visualization of linear regression on a plot.


## How it works

The program generates random data, fits a linear regression model to it , and then creates an animated visualization on the plot using matplotlib.
